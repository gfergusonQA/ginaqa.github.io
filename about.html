    <p>
    I am an experienced QA Engineer who has spent over six years in the tech industry, 
    with a strong foundation of more than 4 years in QA and over 2 years in CX. I've held
    the position of Senior QA Engineer and also previously served as a Mobile 
    Automation Lead at Mercari US. Over the course of my career, I have steadily advanced 
    from a tier 1 agent to ultimately becoming a CX Team Lead before landing in QA. My
    strong background in customer service + support makes me a great eye for testing
    with a customer lens.

    I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Portland Community College 
    and have aspirations of transferring to PSU to complete my studies by 2025-2026. 
    I am proud to share that I have consistently received the President's 
    Honors List award for the past three terms, with a cumulative GPA over 3.5.

    My professional passion is centered around leveraging my QA expertise to ensure
    that technology is accessible for everyone. I am a constant and enthusiastic 
    learner, always exploring new tools and techniques, and I am committed 
    to collaborating with teams to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. 
    Beyond my professional endeavors, I play an active role in the tech community,
    with a particular emphasis on involvement with PDXWit (Portland Women in Tech).

    I love many genres of music (electronic, classical, new beat, EBM, techno, house, and more!)
    and have played music live a few times myself. I have always been an avid music lover 
    ever since I was a kid making mixtapes from listening to Casey Casum, Rick Dees,radio
    show. </p>

    I've always enjoyed absurd humor, especially in old cartoons (re: Space Ghost). 
    Star Trek takes up about 75% of my brainpower half of the time, but thankfully
    it has always inspired me to do the work that I do, and to do it for the greater good.
