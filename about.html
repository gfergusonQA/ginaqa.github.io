    As a Senior QA Engineer and former Mobile Automation Lead at Mercari US, 
    I have over six years of experience in tech, 4+ in QA, and 2+ in CX from 
    tier 1 agent, to CX Team Lead.

    <br><br> I am a JavaScript-certified professional proficient in Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, Python,
    and C++. I have led and contributed to projects involving third-party integrations, 
    database testing, and accessibility testing, enhancing user experience and company 
    performance.<br><br>

    I'm currently studying Computer Science at Portland Community College  as sophomore, with 
    plans to transfer to PSU to complete the degree in 2025-2026. I've been privileged to 
    accept the President's Honors List award my 3-most current terms in a row, with a GPA over 3.5.
    C++ has been a full-time job in mastering, so that has been my school projects' focus.
    <br><br>

    My career passion is leveraging my QA expertise to make technology more accessible 
    for everyone. I am an avid learner and a collaborative team player, constantly exploring
    new tools and techniques to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. Outside of work, 
    I actively participate in the tech community, particularly with PDXWit (Portland Women 
    in Tech).
