As a **Senior QA Engineer** and former **Mobile Automation Lead** at Mercari US, 
I have over six years of experience in testing and developing mobile and web applications. 
I am a **JavaScript-certified professional** proficient in **Ruby**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, 
and **C++**. I have led and contributed to projects involving third-party integrations, 
database testing, and accessibility testing, enhancing user experience and company 
performance.

My career passion is leveraging my QA expertise to make technology more accessible 
for everyone. I am an avid learner and a collaborative team player, constantly exploring
 new tools and techniques to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. Outside of work, 
 I actively participate in the tech community, particularly with **PDXWit (Portland Women 
 in Tech)**.
