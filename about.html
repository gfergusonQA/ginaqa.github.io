    As a <strong>Senior QA Engineer</strong> and former Mobile Automation Lead at Mercari US, 
    I have over six years of experience in testing and developing mobile and web applications. 
    I am a JavaScript-certified professional proficient in Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, 
    and C++. I have led and contributed to projects involving third-party integrations, 
    database testing, and accessibility testing, enhancing user experience and company 
    performance.<br><br>

    My career passion is leveraging my QA expertise to make technology more accessible 
    for everyone. I am an avid learner and a collaborative team player, constantly exploring
    new tools and techniques to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry. Outside of work, 
    I actively participate in the tech community, particularly with PDXWit (Portland Women 
    in Tech).
